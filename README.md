### Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Performing Tiers**:
   - Since **Tier 3** locations are the leading contributors to sales, more marketing and expansion efforts should be targeted in these areas to maximize revenue.
   
2. **Increase Focus on Supermarket Type 1**:
   - With **Supermarket Type 1** contributing the highest sales, investing more in this type of outlet (in terms of inventory management, promotions, and customer experience) could further boost profitability.

3. **Improve Fat Content Offerings**:
   - Since **Regular Fat** items contribute significantly more to total sales than **Low Fat** items, consider expanding offerings or promotions on regular fat items, while also enhancing visibility for low-fat alternatives to appeal to health-conscious customers.

4. **Optimize Item Visibility**:
   - **Supermarket Type 2** and **Supermarket Type 3** have significantly lower item visibility. Initiatives like improved store layouts, promotions, or digital marketing can increase the visibility and sales of items in these outlets.

5. **Target Underperforming Categories**:
   - Some item categories such as **Breakfast Foods**, **Seafood**, and **Starchy Foods** have relatively low sales. Consider revisiting product assortment, pricing strategies, or offering promotions to boost sales in these categories.

6. **Sustain Outlet Growth**:
   - The fluctuation in the establishment of outlets over the years indicates the need for a more consistent growth strategy. Reviving the expansion of outlets, particularly in high-potential areas, can help increase sales.

By addressing these findings, Blinkit can strengthen its retail strategy, improve customer satisfaction, and drive further growth.
